# Code Cracker Curriculum (CCC) 2020

To my lovely wife, Mareike.

Welcome to your advent calender 2020 🎅
This year's edition is going to be different, it's special, so thrilling, you will lovin' it...
But wait, what the f***? 😮

A filthy little mobster 👻 has stolen all of your sweets and hid them all over our house!😱
But do not despair! 😎

Being a wannabe prankster😝, he left behind a series of code puzzles.
Each puzzle consists of a tiny programming exercise that, once solved,
will reveal a secret that leads to the location of your daily sweets 🍬🍭🍫

Apparently, this jerk wasn't very clever nor cautious, as he left traces and hints everywhere.
And, as the last resort, you can always ask your fella 👨💍, of course.
But beware: Cheating won’t help in the long run, because the course
difficulty might adapted dynamically to match your progress 😉

I hope you will enjoy your little journey into the world of coding.
It will require your investigative intuition, combinatory ability and analytic skills 👮‍
But you wanted to learn Python anyway, didn't you? 😉

So let the games begin!
