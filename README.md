# Code Cracker Curriculum (CCC) 2020

To my lovely wife, Mareike.

Welcome to your advent calender 2020 üéÖ
This year's edition is going to be different, it's special, so thrilling, you will lovin' it...
But wait, what the f***? üòÆ

A filthy little mobster üëª has stolen all of your sweets and hid them all over our house!üò±
But do not despair! üòé

Being a wannabe pranksterüòù, he left behind a series of code puzzles.
Each puzzle consists of a tiny programming exercise that, once solved,
will reveal a secret that leads to the location of your daily sweets üç¨üç≠üç´

Apparently, this jerk wasn't very clever nor cautious, as he left traces and hints everywhere.
And, as the last resort, you can always ask your fella üë®üíç, of course.
But beware: Cheating won‚Äôt help in the long run, because the course
difficulty might adapted dynamically to match your progress üòâ

I hope you will enjoy your little journey into the world of coding.
It will require your investigative intuition, combinatory ability and analytic skills üëÆ‚Äç
But you wanted to learn Python anyway, didn't you? üòâ

So let the games begin!

## 2020-12-01, Tuesday, Day 0: Warmup

As every good detective üëÆ‚Äç, before following traces and hunting down wrongdoers üòà,
you have to setup your working environment first. Our ultimate goal is to find all sweets,
hence we need tools that keeps us focussed on cracking the secrets. No muss, no fuss.

From your fellow data scientist you've heard of [Python üêç](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming),
a very popular programming language to get things done.
So let us start!

First, download and install Python 3 and a suitable [IDE](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments)
for Python development on Windows 10.

Examples:
* [`Spyder IDE`](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/spyder/)
  bundled with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (‚ö†Ô∏èRecommended‚ö†Ô∏è)

  *NOTE*:
  > [`Spyder IDE`](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is pre-installed in
  > [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/),
  > which is included in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
  > On the Navigator Home tab, click the Spyder icon.

  Free and open source under MIT license.

* [PyDev](https://www.pydev.org/)

  Python IDE for Eclipse.
  Free and open source under [Eclipse Public License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).

  > The recommended way of using PyDev is bundled in [LiClipse](http://www.liclipse.com/).

* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and
  [install its Python package](https://howtodoinjava.com/python/python-basics/install-python-sublime-editor/)

  > Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license
  > must be purchased for continued use. There is currently no enforced time
  > limit for the evaluation.

Next, fetch [Python script `secret.py`](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day01/secret.py),
open it with your newly installed IDE and hit `RUN`.
That's it for today! Easy start, wasn't it? üòò

## 2020-12-02, Wednesday, Day ‚Ö†: Security through Obscurity

Our favorite villain left us a cryptic message: `QXVmIGRlciBNYXRyYXR6ZSB1bnRlciBkZW0gQmV0dCBpbSBEYWNoZ2VzY2hvc3MK`

This string looks like being [Base64](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/base64-b64encode-in-python/) encoded.
Good for you! Obviously, the mystery-monger did not know that decoding is not encryption and that you
can easily reconstruct the secret by just decoding the base64 string! üêß

Hints:
> Use Python's [base64](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) library to decode the secret!

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~3

## 2020-12-03, Thursday, Day ‚Ö°: World wide investigations

Our jester detected his shortcomings in security and has moved his secrets into the cloud üåé
As if that would safe him...

Download file [`secret.txt`](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day03/secret.txt) using Python
and `print` its context.

Hints:
> Do not even think about using a browser to download that file, it won't work üòâ

> You might use the [`Requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) module for fetching content via HTTP.

> To install additional Python packages, follow install steps for your IDE, e.g.:
> * [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/)
> * Standalone [Spyder IDE](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/38817/pages/downloading-and-installing-packages)
    (Try [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/) first!)
> * [PyDev](https://www.planetofbits.com/python/how-to-install-a-python-package-in-eclipse/)
> * Use [PIP](https://matthewhorne.me/how-to-install-python-and-pip-on-windows-10/), e.g.
    `python -m pip install requests`

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~3-10

## 2020-12-04, Friday, Day ‚Ö¢: Bridging worlds

It's friday and it looks like our stupid buddy is already becoming lazy. One man's loss is another woman's gain üòÅ

Download file [`secret_base64.txt`](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day04/secret_base64.txt),
decode its context and print the results!

Hints:
> Combine your programs from the last two days!

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~4-10

## 2020-12-05, Saturday, Day ‚Ö£: Soul split and retrieval

The horcrux.. ehm.. secret has been cutted into 3 pieces!
Download [all files from here](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day05/) and reconstruct the secret.

Hints:
> Reconstruction requires you to fetch and merge all strings. Doing so does not necessarily imply
> [loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops), although mastering loops might come in handy soon.

> It is not necessary to parse the site or its HTML code in Python, just manually
> search the site for links to files and then download these links within Python!

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~8-10

## 2020-12-06, Sunday, Day ·öè: üçüüçóüç∏

Damn, what a slaughterhouse üî™‚õëüåπüå∑
It looks like this lunatic worked more thoroughly this time:
Our daily secret has been splitted into dozens of pieces!
Download [all files from here](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day06/) and reconstruct the secret!

Hints:
> Do use [loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops).

> It is not necessary to parse the site or its HTML code in Python, just manually
> search the site for links to files, look for repeating pattern(s) within the urls,
> write a loop to generate the urls in Python and then download these urls with Python!

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~8-10

## 2020-12-07, Monday, Day `b0110`: –≤—îœâŒ±—è—î, Œπ Œ±–º ∆íŒ±Œ∑¬¢—É!

You got mail! But.. (‚äô_‚òâ) ..wtf?

To make sense of this pile of byte junk,
you have to `base64`-decode variable `secret`
and write its contents to a `*.docx` file.
Open this `*.docx` file in Word!

Hints:
> No further processing is required, just decode and write to disk.

> Use [Python's `with` statement](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/with-statement-in-python),
> because it will automatically close the file.

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~5-8

## 2020-12-10, Thursday, Day `b1001`: Swarm intelligence

Detective üëÆ‚Äç, we found five individuals that witnessed how our criminal tried to hide his loot.
Due to the corona situation, we'll have to do the questioning of the witnesses remotely.

Send your `{'question': 'What did you see?'}` using `HTTP POST` to
[all witnesses](https://berrendorf.inf.h-brs.de/~jmeng2m/ccc2020/day10/),

search all previous cases to find hints about where our kidnap victim (üç¨) might have been taken to.

Go `get` and `print` all criminal records, there must be something that leads us to today's crime scene!

Hints:
> Use `HTTP GET`, no `HTTP POST` required.

> Note, for security reasons access to our logs is granted via Python only. Browser access has been disabled!

Lines of Code (excl. blank lines): ~10-15

## 2020-12-12, Saturday, Day B: Career Advancement

Your combinatory proficiency and programming skills have been recognized by the federal intelligence service üî´üòé.
You have been asked to help with a mysterious message that was received from unknown origin.

```Python

## 2020-12-13, Sunday, Day C: First day at Bletchley Park

You have been asked to decipher yet another cryptic message:
```Python
cipher = [ 8, 13, 30,  3,  4,
          17, 30, 10, 11,  4,
           8, 13,  4, 13, 30,
          15,  5,  0, 13, 13,
           4, 30, 27,  1,  4,
          17, 30,  3,  4, 12,
          30, 10, 27,  7, 11,
          18,  2,  7, 17,  0,
          13, 10, 30,  8, 13,
          30,  3,  4, 17, 30,
          10, 27,  2,  7,  4 ]
```
Which secret might be concealed within this cryptic message?!?

Ma'am, we just got a call from London!
Our spies found a blueprint of the Enigma machine that was used to encrypt the above's secret:

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# TOP SECRET

Hints:

> No coding required!
> Step through the code line by line to understand its internals.
> Lookup unknown function in the Python documentation,
> e.g. [More on Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists).
> Use pen and paper to track all variables inside and outside of the loop in a
> [table of values](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wertetabelle).
> Once you got an idea of the code, develop an inverse algorithm in pseudo code on paper,
> that rewinds all changes and recovers the original input!

> It is strongly recommended to use a debugger! This allows one to add breakpoints at arbitrary lines of code at which
> the program's execution flow will be interrupted, so that e.g. variable values at the current loop iteration can be
> inspected. [Spyder GUI has a debugger built-in](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/debugging.html).

> IF YOU'RE STUCK, THEN ASK YOUR CHIEF SCIENTIST NEXT DOOR!!!
